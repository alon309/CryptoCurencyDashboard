Important Notice Regarding API Performance
Dear Users,

We hope you are enjoying the experience on our platform. We would like to bring to your attention a known issue that may affect your interaction with our service.

Issue Description
Currently, after selecting a few different coins on our platform, you may encounter a temporary slowdown in the responsiveness of our API. This issue results in a brief period where the system appears to be "stuck" or unresponsive. Please be assured that this is a temporary state, and the system will refresh itself after a few moments.

Temporary Workaround
During this time, we kindly ask for your patience. The API will automatically refresh and return to normal operation shortly. There is no need for any action on your part; simply allow a few moments for the process to complete.

Future Resolution
Our development team is aware of this issue and is actively working on a permanent solution to enhance the performance and reliability of our API. This improvement is part of our commitment to providing you with a seamless and efficient experience on our platform. We anticipate resolving this issue in an upcoming update and will keep you informed on our progress.

Your Experience Matters
Your feedback is invaluable to us. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for how we can improve your experience, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. We are committed to ensuring our platform meets your needs and exceeds your expectations.

Sincerely,

B1 team.
